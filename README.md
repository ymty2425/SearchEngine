## How to start the server?

This is a Python 3.11 FastAPI project with the necessary requirements added to the `requirements.txt`.

### How to install Python 3.11?

[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3112/) installation should be pretty simple. Use your favorite search engine to figure out how to install Python 3.11. Note down the path of your installation.

### Create a virtual environment for your search engine project.

Use the following command to create a virtual environment specifically for SI 650.
Navigate to your search engine project folder and then use the following command:

```
<path of your python installation>/python -m venv si650
```

If you installed Python 3.11 without overwriting the default Python version, use the following command:

```
python3.11 -m venv searchEngine
```

This will create a folder `searchEngine`.

To activate the environment 

- For Windows
```
searchEngine/bin/activate
```
- For others
```
source searchEngine/bin/activate
```

### Install the requirements

After activating the virtual environment, run

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should install the libraries you need to start the server.

### The dataset

1. The dataset should be in JSONL format where each lines is a separate JSON of the following format.

```
{
    "docid": <document id>
    "title": <document title>
    "text": <the entire text of the document>
    "categories": [<each Wikipedia category>]
}
```
**The name of the index folder to be generated is set in the `pipeline.py` file.**

After you have all of these files and the necessary Python requirements installed in your environment, run 

```
python -m uvicorn app:app
```

to start the server.
